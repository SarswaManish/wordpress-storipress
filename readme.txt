#STORIPRESS MIGRATOR - MIGRATE YOUR CONTENT TO STORIPRESS IN 1 CLICK

This official Storipress plugin allows you export your WordPress categories and content in a format that can be easily imported into Storipress.

== Description ==
This plugin is currently in early beta. Help us make the plugin better by opening issues in our [Github repo](https://github.com/storipress/wp-storipress-exporter)!

##Features overview
The Storipress Migrator plugin will export as much blog and publication data as it can into a clean set of exported files. 

- Posts, pages, tags and authors are all automatically exported and recreated for Storipress
- Content categories will be converted automatically into desks.
- Storipress comes with native Disqus comments. 
- Storipress does not have built-in comments, but it does integrate with Disqus. Provided that your URL is the same on Storipress, Disqus will automatically migrate your comments across to Storipress.
- Exporting meta is only supported for users using Yoast (for now). If you use another SEO plugin, please create an issue in our Github repo, or modify the plugin and create a pull request!
